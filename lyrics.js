  // Album: Music to Practice Safe Sex to

  // Overly Verbose Email Series pt. III:

`I drained you when you were empty this time, you were right 
You thought it was for validation, maybe you were overthinking it
I think you were`,

`I tried to tell you what I meant by those words that night
I didn't wanna make assumptions, and you didn't wanna say it
I'm glad you did`,

`You go off the radar, stop responding, leave me hanging
because you know it hurts me, I guess that I deserve it`,
  
`I broke another promise to myself,
I'm in debt`,

`This is a pattern that I never meant to start
This is a feeling that you were never meant to feel`,

`I wish I could show you what you meant in my own language`,

`I could make a list of all the things that make you enjoyable
 but you would probably crumple it up and label it an act of pity`,

`But people like you, you're just blinded by your own self hate
 and everybody's rooting for you`,

`When will you listen up
or just keep writing me off, writing me off, you just keep writing me off`,

  // Borderline:

  `Go ahead, throw me the rope you know I'm too afraid to take`,

  `Hand me the vase you know I'll drop
and watch it shatter, watch me fumble for the pieces`,

  `You've got me comfortable
in this pit that you dug just for me`,

`You've seen how I tend to stay when I know I'm supposed to leave`,

  `Wearing the clothes of a girl you wish you were today
but you'll change out of them when the sun comes up`,

  `now you're trying my clothes, wearing my clothes, it's my turn
but none of them fit, none of them fit none of them fit`,

  `I was the one who wouldn't leave
You always loved to watch me bleed`,

`I know you get a sick pleasure
I hope it makes you feel better
to know you're killing me`,

`Don't say you miss me
I learned my lesson last time I fell into your trap`,

`Don't say you miss me
I should rip your throat out for what you've done to me`,

// Erso 

`I heard you were trying to better yourself
but I don't really care to hear it, I don't really keep my ears open for that anymore`,

`I heard you were getting a little lonely
but if anything you have each other I'm not gonna be your feminine vessel to pour into anymore`,

`I go back and forth between wanting to help you
but I've done my time and it would be no use`,

`you took a lot from me
you two took a lot, you took a lot, you took a lot from us
you took what mattered, what mattered the most
and this is me taking it back`,

`and was it worth it
you try to fix it
it doesn't hurt
it doesn't hurt anymore`,

// $5 Subtweet

`you remind me of
a version of myself
that never learned
to self reflect`,

`passive aggression is your route of choice
I think you like being mad
oh you do, it's kinda sick`, 

`so hold your breath
take a sip of water
count to ten
think of your happy place`,

`god I hope you look back at this and laugh half as hard as I am now`,

`it used to get to me
but I'm passed that now`,

`tag yourself we all know who that was about
I'd jump right in but 140 characters isn't enough to say what I think`,

`and I think we should all try to grow the fuck up`,

`say it to my face, I know it can be hard
after all I can relate, petty is my
middle name`,

`I don't like the taste of soap
but I learned to scrub my tongue
you ought to try it
but that's not your style`,

`those words, you like the way they taste when they leave your mouth`,

`how they won't go bland
and they'll get you what you want, every time
they'll get you what you want`, 

`I shouldn't have told you that I kind of tend to jump into these kinds of things
that was the moment I made a target of myself`,

`thought it was the last time I'd be coming over again
no, you took your time with me`,

`I'd pay to travel back in time and warn myself she's gonna try to ruin you`,

`oh, but it'll be alright
you're gonna get away just fine`,


`this is not what I thought friendship looked like`,

`I can recognize the red flags that you planted now
and I won't ignore them next time`,

// Five-Time 2nd Place Winner

`you tried to break me down
you warped every mirror in my house
but I see through it now, and I know I'm not looking at a monster`,

`I won't let you get away with this
cause I was always the strong one
and I will always be the strong one here`,

`I told someone about you and now I'm
drifting, I'm tasting independence`,

`for the first time in a year
and it feels like a new, it feels like a new feeling`,

`cause I was your puppet, your project for so long`,

`and I can almost hear the snapping of your bones
and the voices that your silencing for your own gain`,

`I can hear it in my sleep, I hear it echo in my dreams
I won't do it, I won't do it`,

`and I crave to see the water from your eyes forming puddles in your sheets`,

`to see black clay smeared on your pillowcase
give you a taste of what you did to me`,

` it doesn't feel too good now does it 
take your pointed finger and turn it around`,

`I'm waiting, I'll keep an eye out next time I run into someone like you`,

`and I can almost hear the snapping of their bones
and the sound they'll make when I say their name`,


//  I Know It's Only Fair

`let's get this money`,

`thought I was safe this time around
for what it's worth you said you wouldn't do this
but if I keep this up I know good and well I need to learn that`,

`this is more than a coincidence
I've seen it happen one too many times
you knew exactly who you stood behind`,

`you knew your place right from the start and now I see mine
I'll try to remember you the way that you were`,

`it's getting harder I'm trying not to forget it
cause now everything goes to your head, and I don't want to contribute`,

`you're only being fair`,

`I've never felt more pretentious in the best and the worst way than when you and I were six shots deep into bottom shelf whisky watching audiotree of this town needs guns`,

`critiquing everything and watching videos of your band that I wish I didn't like so much`,

`I know you said it's not the end of it
but I can sense every ounce of your hesitation`,

`I know I promised I would wait around
but I've got an ego and a lot of pride`,

`and it's not as hard as I thought it would be
recently you've been making it pretty easy`,

`and I think I like it better this way
and I know you're not complaining`, 

// Patterns 

`I've been watching you and it's a pretty dance you often do, it rings a bell front row and center pew`,

`and I can taste them, the edges of your words are trimmed in gold and separated into verses in the back of my tongue`,

`and I see ashes on your forehead that aren't there but I've got rug burns on my knees, itching underneath tight denim
you're no different than you're enemy`,

`this is not a competition, but I see you in the corner of my eye you're keeping score`,

`you're no better than this
this is a show that I've seen before`,

`I've seen both sides and I recognize these patterns`,

`and it's in your head
it was always there 
and it's in there now 
and it always will be`,

`it's not their fault, 
no it's not their fault, 
no it's no ones fault
it was in your head, 
it's all in your head,
and it's here to stay`,

`and I spent one too many nights banging my head against the wall to hear another voice telling me that I'm doing something wrong`,

`so excommunicate me 
you're no better than the fucked up doctrine that sent me running to your doorstep in the first place`,

`I knew better than this
you're better than this`,

// Rick's Toy Box

`and you started to look ahead
you took a step back and then you, you, you
and you started to look afraid`,

`if none of it mattered
then why did I see you trying
and why did I see you crack`,

`when I started to notice that you could be replaced by $20 at an adult entertainment store and my right hand is all I really need, you're just kinda fun to watch
funny how you got it backwards`, 

`a misinterpretation at its best, we can agree
I tried to tell you but you didn't want to hear it 
you're ego was in the way`,

`I'm not as nervous as I may have seemed that night but I'll give you that`,

`I never wanted it to head in this direction but like you said, that's what you get`,

`and you were just projecting
said you were just projecting
yeah I knew it the whole time
cause I knew what I was
and I know what I was
I know what I am`,

//  Album: POOL

// BLOOM

`You had your warning, but your greed, it clogged your ears`,

`and now you start to see it we've been telling you for fucking years`,

`Blood on your hands
Dead in the water
You won't know what you have done
Until it's over`, 

`Like the sky rained blood for Sarpedon
The sea turns red for Aphrodite`,

`Lying to yourself that the blood tastes sweet
You want your sugar?
Come and get it`,

// TEETHING

`I can feel you breathing
You're filling up this room
I can hear you teething
I've watched you since the fucking womb`,

`I see you pacing
It's a guilty plan
Your thoughts are screaming
and I know them like the back of my fucking hand`,

`Count to ten
You kept your word
So you could make amends`,

`Count to ten
You kept your promise to start this over again
but it's getting out of hand`,


// Album: S/T

// Conscious Uncoupling

`I'm probably never gonna clean this house again
I'm probably never gonna see your mom again
We'll probably never see eye to eye, oh
I know exactly when you'll say goodbye`,

`I never wanna hear that tone of voice again
I never wanna see that stupid look on your face again`,

`I never wanna feel like I am wasting your time, oh
I think we're gonna get along just fine`,

`We let the weeds grow out
Within a year they'd taken over the side of our shotgun house`,

`Got a notice from the city
Threw it in the trash on the night of Thanksgiving`,

`and if I'm being honest
I'll probably miss the stupid walks
You'd drag me out of bed to take`,

`But it's easier to hate you
It's easier to try to find a better reason why`,

`So here we are on this stupid couch again
I never wanna see you lift the corners of your mouth again`,

`Oh, I would pay to see the look in your eye
You've got a lot of nerve to be asking me why`,

`Get out of my house
We've got nothing left to talk about`,

`And I'm not acting out of spite
You just couldn't play your cards right`,

`Say it like you mean it
That this is how it has to be
Took everything you had
To take a part of me`,

`I'd do anything to say we'll look back at this and laugh
You swore you wouldn't but you
You still have time to take it back`,

// That's Physics, Baby

`You've got this way about you
Something I hate about you, every time`,

`Picking and choosing, winning and losing
You can't justify
I'll never win you over just by exposure
Oh, I can pick a fight`,

`Watch it pass you by, name a better high
We could've made a scene all night`,

`Going into the day, name a better way
For you to call it by its name`,

`Clock feels like it's moving backwards
And I don't have the time`,

`Can't quite tell what you've ever been after
Clockwork motor, you wind me up again`, 

`I'm a tempered glass that you never could shatter
Hanging by a thread, oh it's gotta be the end`,


`I'm telling what I, telling you what I need`,

`See it all in print, so I know it's real
What's a better way to waste my time?`,

`After time, you don't have to lie
There's another door behind me`,

`Clock feels like it's moving backwards
And I just pass the time`,

`I never know if I'm getting straight answers
Swallow 'em whole with an extra grain of salt`,

`I won't get by if I'm minding my manners
Only in time, and if you're admitting fault`,

`Tip of my tongue, I almost taste it
Tell me what exactly it is you're so afraid of`,

`We've come too far to just waste it
Show me these beautiful things you say you're made of`,

`Crumple me up like a candy wrapper
Throw me away, I'd rather not pretend`,
