  // Album: Music to Practice Safe Sex to

  // Overly Verbose Email Series pt. III:

`I drained you when you were empty this time, you were right 
You thought it was for validation, maybe you were overthinking it
I think you were`,

`I tried to tell you what I meant by those words that night
I didn't wanna make assumptions, and you didn't wanna say it
I'm glad you did`,

`You go off the radar, stop responding, leave me hanging
because you know it hurts me, I guess that I deserve it`,
  
`I broke another promise to myself,
I'm in debt`,

`This is a pattern that I never meant to start
This is a feeling that you were never meant to feel`,

`I wish I could show you what you meant in my own language`,

`I could make a list of all the things that make you enjoyable
 but you would probably crumple it up and label it an act of pity`,

`But people like you, you're just blinded by your own self hate
 and everybody's rooting for you`,

`When will you listen up
or just keep writing me off, writing me off, you just keep writing me off`,

  // Borderline:

  `Go ahead, throw me the rope you know I'm too afraid to take`,

  `Hand me the vase you know I'll drop
and watch it shatter, watch me fumble for the pieces`,

  `You've got me comfortable
in this pit that you dug just for me`,

`You've seen how I tend to stay when I know I'm supposed to leave`,

  `Wearing the clothes of a girl you wish you were today
but you'll change out of them when the sun comes up`,

  `now you're trying my clothes, wearing my clothes, it's my turn
but none of them fit, none of them fit none of them fit`,

  `I was the one who wouldn't leave
You always loved to watch me bleed`,

`I know you get a sick pleasure
I hope it makes you feel better
to know you're killing me`,

`Don't say you miss me
I learned my lesson last time I fell into your trap`,

`Don't say you miss me
I should rip your throat out for what you've done to me`,

// Erso 

`I heard you were trying to better yourself
but I don't really care to hear it, I don't really keep my ears open for that anymore`,

`I heard you were getting a little lonely
but if anything you have each other I'm not gonna be your feminine vessel to pour into anymore`,

`I go back and forth between wanting to help you
but I've done my time and it would be no use`,

`you took a lot from me
you two took a lot, you took a lot, you took a lot from us
you took what mattered, what mattered the most
and this is me taking it back`,

`and was it worth it
you try to fix it
it doesn't hurt
it doesn't hurt anymore`,

// $5 Subtweet

`you remind me of
a version of myself
that never learned
to self reflect`,

`passive aggression is your route of choice
I think you like being mad
oh you do, it's kinda sick`, 

`so hold your breath
take a sip of water
count to ten
think of your happy place`,

`god I hope you look back at this and laugh half as hard as I am now`,

`it used to get to me
but I'm passed that now`,

`tag yourself we all know who that was about
I'd jump right in but 140 characters isn't enough to say what I think`,

`and I think we should all try to grow the fuck up`,

`say it to my face, I know it can be hard
after all I can relate, petty is my
middle name`,

`I don't like the taste of soap
but I learned to scrub my tongue
you ought to try it
but that's not your style`,

`those words, you like the way they taste when they leave your mouth`,

`how they won't go bland
and they'll get you what you want, every time
they'll get you what you want`, 

`I shouldn't have told you that I kind of tend to jump into these kinds of things
that was the moment I made a target of myself`,

`thought it was the last time I'd be coming over again
no, you took your time with me`,

`I'd pay to travel back in time and warn myself she's gonna try to ruin you`,

`oh, but it'll be alright
you're gonna get away just fine`,


`this is not what I thought friendship looked like`,

`I can recognize the red flags that you planted now
and I won't ignore them next time`,

// Five-Time 2nd Place Winner

`you tried to break me down
you warped every mirror in my house
but I see through it now, and I know I'm not looking at a monster`,

`I won't let you get away with this
cause I was always the strong one
and I will always be the strong one here`,

`I told someone about you and now I'm
drifting, I'm tasting independence`,

`for the first time in a year
and it feels like a new, it feels like a new feeling`,

`cause I was your puppet, your project for so long`,

`and I can almost hear the snapping of your bones
and the voices that your silencing for your own gain`,

`I can hear it in my sleep, I hear it echo in my dreams
I won't do it, I won't do it`,

`and I crave to see the water from your eyes forming puddles in your sheets`,

`to see black clay smeared on your pillowcase
give you a taste of what you did to me`,

` it doesn't feel too good now does it 
take your pointed finger and turn it around`,

`I'm waiting, I'll keep an eye out next time I run into someone like you`,

`and I can almost hear the snapping of their bones
and the sound they'll make when I say their name`,


//  I Know It's Only Fair

`let's get this money`,

`thought I was safe this time around
for what it's worth you said you wouldn't do this
but if I keep this up I know good and well I need to learn that`,

`this is more than a coincidence
I've seen it happen one too many times
you knew exactly who you stood behind`,

`you knew your place right from the start and now I see mine
I'll try to remember you the way that you were`,

`it's getting harder I'm trying not to forget it
cause now everything goes to your head, and I don't want to contribute`,

`you're only being fair`,

`I've never felt more pretentious in the best and the worst way than when you and I were six shots deep into bottom shelf whisky watching audiotree of this town needs guns`,

`critiquing everything and watching videos of your band that I wish I didn't like so much`,

`I know you said it's not the end of it
but I can sense every ounce of your hesitation`,

`I know I promised I would wait around
but I've got an ego and a lot of pride`,

`and it's not as hard as I thought it would be
recently you've been making it pretty easy`,

`and I think I like it better this way
and I know you're not complaining`, 

// Patterns 

`I've been watching you and it's a pretty dance you often do, it rings a bell front row and center pew`,

`and I can taste them, the edges of your words are trimmed in gold and separated into verses in the back of my tongue`,

`and I see ashes on your forehead that aren't there but I've got rug burns on my knees, itching underneath tight denim
you're no different than you're enemy`,

`this is not a competition, but I see you in the corner of my eye you're keeping score`,

`you're no better than this
this is a show that I've seen before`,

`I've seen both sides and I recognize these patterns`,

`and it's in your head
it was always there 
and it's in there now 
and it always will be`,

`it's not their fault, 
no it's not their fault, 
no it's no ones fault
it was in your head, 
it's all in your head,
and it's here to stay`,

`and I spent one too many nights banging my head against the wall to hear another voice telling me that I'm doing something wrong`,

`so excommunicate me 
you're no better than the fucked up doctrine that sent me running to your doorstep in the first place`,

`I knew better than this
you're better than this`,

// Rick's Toy Box

`and you started to look ahead
you took a step back and then you, you, you
and you started to look afraid`,

`if none of it mattered
then why did I see you trying
and why did I see you crack`,

`when I started to notice that you could be replaced by $20 at an adult entertainment store and my right hand is all I really need, you're just kinda fun to watch
funny how you got it backwards`, 

`a misinterpretation at its best, we can agree
I tried to tell you but you didn't want to hear it 
you're ego was in the way`,

`I'm not as nervous as I may have seemed that night but I'll give you that`,

`I never wanted it to head in this direction but like you said, that's what you get`,

`and you were just projecting
said you were just projecting
yeah I knew it the whole time
cause I knew what I was
and I know what I was
I know what I am`,

//  Album: POOL

// BLOOM

`You had your warning, but your greed, it clogged your ears`,

`and now you start to see it we've been telling you for fucking years`,

`Blood on your hands
Dead in the water
You won't know what you have done
Until it's over`, 

`Like the sky rained blood for Sarpedon
The sea turns red for Aphrodite`,

`Lying to yourself that the blood tastes sweet
You want your sugar?
Come and get it`,

// TEETHING

`I can feel you breathing
You're filling up this room
I can hear you teething
I've watched you since the fucking womb`,

`I see you pacing
It's a guilty plan
Your thoughts are screaming
and I know them like the back of my fucking hand`,

`Count to ten
You kept your word
So you could make amends`,

`Count to ten
You kept your promise to start this over again
but it's getting out of hand`,


// Album: S/T

// Conscious Uncoupling

`I'm probably never gonna clean this house again
I'm probably never gonna see your mom again
We'll probably never see eye to eye, oh
I know exactly when you'll say goodbye`,

`I never wanna hear that tone of voice again
I never wanna see that stupid look on your face again`,

`I never wanna feel like I am wasting your time, oh
I think we're gonna get along just fine`,

`We let the weeds grow out
Within a year they'd taken over the side of our shotgun house`,

`Got a notice from the city
Threw it in the trash on the night of Thanksgiving`,

`and if I'm being honest
I'll probably miss the stupid walks
You'd drag me out of bed to take`,

`But it's easier to hate you
It's easier to try to find a better reason why`,

`So here we are on this stupid couch again
I never wanna see you lift the corners of your mouth again`,

`Oh, I would pay to see the look in your eye
You've got a lot of nerve to be asking me why`,

`Get out of my house
We've got nothing left to talk about`,

`And I'm not acting out of spite
You just couldn't play your cards right`,

`Say it like you mean it
That this is how it has to be
Took everything you had
To take a part of me`,

`I'd do anything to say we'll look back at this and laugh
You swore you wouldn't but you
You still have time to take it back`,

// That's Physics, Baby

`You've got this way about you
Something I hate about you, every time`,

`Picking and choosing, winning and losing
You can't justify
I'll never win you over just by exposure
Oh, I can pick a fight`,

`Watch it pass you by, name a better high
We could've made a scene all night`,

`Going into the day, name a better way
For you to call it by its name`,

`Clock feels like it's moving backwards
And I don't have the time`,

`Can't quite tell what you've ever been after
Clockwork motor, you wind me up again`, 

`I'm a tempered glass that you never could shatter
Hanging by a thread, oh it's gotta be the end`,


`I'm telling what I, telling you what I need`,

`See it all in print, so I know it's real
What's a better way to waste my time?`,

`After time, you don't have to lie
There's another door behind me`,

`Clock feels like it's moving backwards
And I just pass the time`,

`I never know if I'm getting straight answers
Swallow 'em whole with an extra grain of salt`,

`I won't get by if I'm minding my manners
Only in time, and if you're admitting fault`,

`Tip of my tongue, I almost taste it
Tell me what exactly it is you're so afraid of`,

`We've come too far to just waste it
Show me these beautiful things you say you're made of`,

`Crumple me up like a candy wrapper
Throw me away, I'd rather not pretend`,

// Almost Always Better (Almost Always Worse)

`I still think about what you said
I still hear it ring in my head
I'm counting the colors I haven't bled
Warming the layers I haven't shed`,

`Recurring dreams of a place in time
Where I wake up and I'm feeling fine`,

`Resurface the mental dichotomy
Of what's ahead or in front of me`,

`The face you make when I humor you
The space I take when I fill a room
Overstimulation, without hesitation
I'm running in circles around you`,

`Guess I'll never win
Guess I'm a hypocrite
It came flooding in
I still wanted it`,

`I still think about what you said
I still hear it ring in my head
I'm watching your colors in infrared
Playing you like a marionette again`, 

`Do you hear that?
That's the sound of me minding my own damn business
Yeah, do you hear that?
That's the sound of me taking my own advice`,

`But I could take a rope and run it
Through the spaces in your mind and pull it tight`,

`And I could weigh you down with all the
Asphalt pumping through my veins, only if you'd like`,

`'Cause I like you, I really like you
So I'll spare you, I'll spare you the details again`,

// Further 

`Do you remember the things I used to tell you?
About all the things I wanted to feel but thought I wasn't allowed to?`,

`How I was happy in my dream last night and
Didn't feel guilty when I reached for your hand
I wanna see it in my sleep again
Wanna be told it's not a deadly sin`,

`Do you remember the night she tried to change you?
On the foot of my hotel bed I watched the color leave your face, it's burned in my brain`,

`But I got a good laugh out of my friends today and
I didn't need a pill to make me okay`,

`I wanna see it when it really sets in
Wanna be laughing when it breaks your skin`,

`Do you feel guilty?
Do you feel anything at all?
Does it feel weird?
To have yourself up against a wall?`,

`Like stealing candy from a baby
Not what it took for you to hate me
And I might listen through the wall
But I won't tell anything at all`,

// Talk Too Much

`You talk too much
I can't hear my own thoughts over your performative opinions`,

`I'll take it up with all your little minions
Cause they're afraid of you anyway`,

`I think I'll pass, after all no one asked
I guess they don't have to
To get a piece of you tonight`,

`Oh, I'll bet you're fun at parties
Bet you're the last one to leave`,

`Why can't we call it even?
I worked so hard to scrub it clean and then
You fucked it up again
Got caught up in your head`,

`What's the use in us playing pretend?
I'm holding more spite than anyone would recommend
It's eating me alive
It's rotting my insides`,

`You play too rough
Try to act so tough with your silly regurgitated opinions
Speaking over the people you say you're lifting`,

`And you talk too much
Always showing up with a round of verbal ammunition
Now I'm ganging up with all your little minions
Cause they're afraid of you
And I'm afraid of you`,

`I guess that means you win
You're underneath my skin
And you've been comfortable there for quite some time now
While I've been learning how to, learning how to ignore you`,

`Why can't we call it even?
I tried so hard to not be so mean
And then it started to make sense
Played the motions through my head`,

`If you're the one who's always on the offense
No one's gonna think to check inside your closet
Skeletons collecting dust
Sorted neatly, one by one`,

`Cause people like you, they know how to get what they want`,

`And people like you
They know how to get ahead
They'll twist around what you never said
They'll chase you back and forth again`,

`People like you
They don't like you
And if you want to
You could get the things that you like`,

// Comes In Waves

`I can lie too
I know you don't think I have it in me
But what if I do?`,

`Woke up feeling like myself today
For a minute there, I
I couldn't tell who's who`,

`I've said it once to you before
And I'll say it all again real slow this time
I won't miss losing out on what I never try to find`,

`And what about you?
I'll bet you didn't think we'd make it this far
But we've made do`,

`Sometimes I wonder if you're boring
But you know I only ask it out of spite
'Cause I can't sleep without a fight`,

`I'll keep the peace and hold it in
Yeah, I learned it from the best`,

`I'll let you keep your space, or maybe
I call the shots until you pass my stupid little test
And then I store it for later`,

`it comes in waves
 No it never stays, 
 it just comes in waves`,

 `I am the dirt that keeps them buried in the layers of the earth
 The searing bulb that prays they never see the natural sun`,

 `I am the green of every sepal holding fertile blossoms shut
 The bind of every grip around the bases of their ripened stems
 But when they bloom, they look so precious
 But only by my side`,

 `I don't know why
 Tell me now, what's on your mind?`,

 `Just let me stay and try again, I promise you
 I can rewind`,

 `it comes in waves
 Oh, I promise it never stays
 It just comes in waves`,

//  I Hope You're Right

`I've been avoiding this conversation
Don't want to ruin your reputation`,

`I think you got a misdiagnosis
You just don't know what control is`,

`Say you're sorry with a thousand roses
You wanna “make it right”
You got me laughing now`,

`You wanna start a fight
You wanna start a fight
Cause you're always right`,

`Right where you want to be
Minimum wage
The only people that are nice to you
Are getting paid`,

`It's been a thorn in your ass now for way too long
You make it up as you go along`,

`Do you think about me
The way I think about you?
You know I'm not stupid there's just
Still so much left to undo`,

// Swallow

`You always told me I'd get over it
I always said that you were wrong`,

`I'm disappointed, but not surprised
Some kind of quick-witted monologue`,

`You said that you could almost picture it
But it's not smart to shit where you eat`,

`And when I said I would consider it
I was lying, lying through my teeth`,

`Can't put my finger on it
Don't know what makes it so appealing
I'm not begging for your affection
I'm just addicted to the feeling`,

`I think I'm slowing down
I feel you slipping now
You've seen and I know how
It tends to flicker out`,

`I was there when you were fun
I'm like ice stuck to your tongue
Dusty sweater in your trunk
I can take a joke and run`,

`I see you standing around
Drinking beer outside of your house
I can almost make out the vowels
I know what you talk about`,

`I thought about bringing you flowers
To try to turn it around
Gave up and stood in the shower
I'll make do with or without`,

`But the uniform never quite fit
Antithesis to all your ways
How the fuck am I convincing you?`,
