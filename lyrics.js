// Album: Music to Practice Safe Sex to


// Overly Verbose Email Series pt. III:

  `I drained you when you were empty this time, you were right 
You thought it was for validation, maybe you were overthinking it
I think you were`,

  `I tried to tell you what i meant by those words that night
I didn't wanna make assumptions, and you didn't wanna say it
I'm glad you did`,

  `You go off the radar, stop responding, leave me hanging
 because you know it hurts me, i guess that i deserve it`,

  `I broke another promise to myself
 I'm in debt`,

  `This is a pattern that i never meant to start
 This is a feeling that you were never meant to feel`,

  `I wish i could show you what you meant in my own language`,

  `I could make a list of all the things that make you enjoyable
 but you would probably crumple it up and label it an act of pity`,

  `But people like you, you're just blinded by your own self hate
 and everybody's rooting for you`,

  `When will you listen up
or just keep writing me off, writing me off, you just keep writing me off`,


// Borderline:

`Go ahead, throw me the rope you know i'm too afraid to take`,

`Hand me the vase you know i'll drop
and watch it shatter, watch me fumble for the pieces`,

`You've got me comfortable
in this pit that you dug just for me`,

`You've seen how i tend to stay when i know i'm supposed to leave`,

`Wearing the clothes of a girl you wish you were today
but you'll change out of them when the sun comes up`,

`now you're trying my clothes, wearing my clothes, it's my turn
but none of them fit, none of them fit none of them fit`,

`I was the one who wouldn't leave
You always loved to watch me bleed`,

`I know you get a sick pleasure
I hope it makes you feel better
to know you're killing me`,

`Don't say you miss me
I learned my lesson last time i fell into your trap`,

`Don't say you miss me
I should rip your throat out for what you've done to me`,
